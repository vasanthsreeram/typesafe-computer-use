**typesafe-computer-use** drives a Mac toward a goal you type in plain English, for about a
fiftieth of a cent per step. It never sends a screenshot to a big model. Instead it
reads the screen deterministically, asks a small classifier which action comes next,
and only calls a writing model when a text field genuinely needs free text.

```
clicker "go to techcrunch and take me to the checkout page for the cheapest tickets to their next upcoming event" --act
```

## Why

Frontier-model computer use is capable and expensive: every step ships a screenshot and
waits several seconds for a plan. Most steps do not need a plan. They need one choice
from a short list, made quickly and cheaply, with a confidence number you can gate on.

[TypeSafe](https://docs.typesafe.ai) sells exactly that: a decision model that answers
a `Choice` over up to 255 options with a full probability distribution and a calibrated
confidence, in a few hundred milliseconds, with free output tokens. This project is a
computer-use loop built around it.

Measured on the same screenshot and goal, one decision each:

| | typesafe (jev) | Claude Opus 5, bare screenshot | multiplier |
|---|---|---|---|
| input tokens | 4,882 | 4,785 | same |
| cost per decision | $0.0002 | $0.032 | 155x cheaper |
| cost per decision, realistic loop with history | $0.0002 | $0.035 to $0.08 | 170x to 390x cheaper |
| cost per 12-step task | $0.003 | $0.40 to $0.90 | 130x to 300x cheaper |
| model latency | 0.13 to 0.38 s | 5.2 s | 14x to 40x faster |
| end-to-end step, with capture and OCR | about 1.5 s | about 5.5 s | 3.7x faster |

The honest caveat: the big model read the event dates off the pixels and compared them
unaided. The classifier needed the date parsing described below. Every piece of
reasoning the frontier model does for free has to be rebuilt here as deterministic state.

## Install

macOS 14 or newer, Python 3.12 or newer, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```
git clone https://github.com/awlevin/typesafe-computer-use
cd typesafe-computer-use
uv sync
cp .env.example .env     # fill in the keys
```

| variable | required | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | yes | every decision |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | no | `type_text` and writer-proposed URLs |
| `CLICKER_EMAIL` | no | enables the `type_email` action |
| `CLICKER_BROWSER` | no | defaults to `Google Chrome` |
| `CLICKER_WRITER_MODEL` | no | defaults to `claude-haiku-4-5` |

Grant your terminal **Screen Recording** and **Accessibility** in System Settings >
Privacy & Security. Without the first, captures are wallpaper. Without the second,
synthetic clicks are silently dropped, and `--act` refuses to start.

## Use

```
uv run clicker "open the Playground"                 # dry run: one step, prints what it would do
uv run clicker "open the Playground" --act           # drives the machine, up to 12 steps
uv run clicker "log in" --act --steps 20 --delay 3   # longer and slower
uv run clicker-inspect "any goal"                    # 3-2-1, capture, open the annotated screen + payload
```

Clear the terminal first. It is on screen, so its text is OCR input.

**Stopping a live run.** Ctrl-C when the terminal has focus, or slam the mouse into the
top-left corner of the screen from any app. The loop also stops itself on `done` or
`none`, on confidence under `--min-confidence` (0.4), after two consecutive no-ops, or
at `--steps`.

## Browser backend: DOM perception, no OCR

`macos.py` drives whatever is on screen. For the browser there is a second backend that
never looks at pixels: it reads the DOM over the Chrome DevTools Protocol, so it needs no
Screen Recording permission and cannot fight you for the cursor.

```
uv run clicker-bench loop --fixture --runs runs         # end-to-end step loop
uv run clicker-bench perception --url https://news.ycombinator.com
uv run clicker-bench replay --run runs/<ts> --step 2    # re-decide a saved step offline
```

Perception, same page, same machine, same moment, one decision each. The TypeSafe call is
identical in both paths, so the difference is purely how the screen is read:

| page | DOM (browser backend) | screencapture + Vision OCR | ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| local fixture | 1.3 ms (28 elements) | 288.0 ms (31 blocks) | 221x |
| news.ycombinator.com | 4.5 ms (120 elements) | 697.3 ms (46 blocks) | 155x |
| en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore | 14.4 ms (91 elements) | 897.0 ms (50 blocks) | 62x |

The OCR column is roughly 143-177 ms capture + 573-710 ms Vision OCR + ~0.2 ms merge.

Speed is the smaller half of it. OCR reproduced only 7/13, 7/88 and 3/85 of the DOM's labels
verbatim across those pages — under 10% on real sites. A classifier choosing between OCR
blocks is choosing between garbled strings; a classifier choosing between DOM elements is
choosing between the page's actual labels.

End-to-end loop, p50: **302-380 ms per step** (2.6-3.5 steps/sec), of which ~280-350 ms is
the TypeSafe decision. Perception is now ~0% of a step.

```
Runtime.evaluate ─► ordered element list (text, role, click point, on-screen, covered)
                     │
        ONE TypeSafe request, two Choices
        kind    : click | type_text | navigate | press_enter | scroll_down | ... | done
        element : which on-screen element (used only when kind is click)
                     │
        real Input events ─► observe-until-changed ─► next step
```

The action set is filtered to what the page can actually do: no `type_text` without a field
and something to type, no `scroll_down` when the document does not scroll, no `back` with
empty history. An option the loop cannot execute is a guaranteed stall, and it reads as
model doubt when the model was never at fault.

The post-action observation and the next step's perception are the same call, so waiting
costs no extra round trip.

### Where browser free text comes from

The same rule as above — `compose_browser_text` with a structured reply — plus a code-side
credential guard that refuses a credential-shaped field *before* the model is asked. Every
step records provenance (`writer` / `writer_declined` / `regex_fallback`) in the step line
and the run folder. The regex fallback exists so the benchmark measures the decision loop
rather than a second model call; the writer takes over whenever credentials resolve.

### Browser run folder and replay

`runs/<timestamp>/` in the same shape, with `step-NN-elements.json` as the replayable
artefact, since a browser step has no pixels to re-capture:

```
run.log, run.json
step-NN-payload.txt   the exact `state` and every Choice criteria sent
step-NN-state.json    the state, for comparison on replay
step-NN-answers.json  every probability returned
step-NN-elements.json everything perception returned, for offline replay
```

`clicker-bench replay` rebuilds the page from that file and reports whether the
reconstructed state matches the saved one, so a stall can be re-decided without a browser.

### Browser limits

Viewport only, the same as OCR only saw the visible screen; elements below the fold need
`scroll_down` first. The DOM sees elements rather than paint, so canvas-drawn UI and text
baked into images are invisible here and **are** visible to OCR — use `macos.py` for those.
One tab, one page target, no iframes or shadow-DOM piercing.

## How a step works

```
screencapture ─► Vision OCR ─► merge lines into blocks ─► drop lines echoing the goal
                     │
accessibility ─► focused field (role, label, placeholder, value, frame)
AppleScript   ─► frontmost app, active tab URL
clock         ─► local date and time
dates.py      ─► "dated 2026-10-13 (in 27 days)" on any block containing a date,
                 "near a line dated ..." on its neighbours
                     │
                     ▼
        one TypeSafe request, three Choices
        ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │ kind  : click_item | open_site | type_text | scroll… │
        │ item  : which OCR block (used only for click_item)   │
        │ site  : which catalog site (used only for open_site) │
        └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
        deterministic action ─► wait ─► next step
```

Splitting the decision into three questions keeps screen noise out of the action
choice. Every stall found while building this came from two options that meant the
same thing. Confidence measures concentration, so overlapping options always read as
doubt. Keep the action set mutually exclusive.

### Action space

| key | does |
|---|---|
| `click_item` | click the center of the chosen OCR block, converted from Retina pixels to points |
| `open_site` | AppleScript `open location` for a `SITES` catalog entry, or a URL the writer proposes |
| `switch_to_browser` | bring the browser forward to continue with a page already open there |
| `type_text` | the writer composes the string; a TypeSafe Noul then checks the field's value |
| `type_email` | types `$CLICKER_EMAIL`; refused unless a text field is focused |
| `press_enter`, `press_escape` | keyboard |
| `scroll_down`, `scroll_up` | 10 lines, after parking the cursor over the frontmost window |
| `wait` | screen still loading |
| `done`, `none` | stop |

### Where free text comes from

The classifier never generates text. The writer model runs in two places, each with a
small packet and a structured reply:

- **`type_text`** receives the goal, recent actions, the focused field's label and
  placeholder, and the OCR lines near the field. It returns `{fill, text}`. Credential
  fields come back `fill: false` and nothing is typed. After typing, a Noul scores
  whether the field now holds a sensible value. Under 0.5 the field is cleared.
- **`open_site`** with no catalog match receives the goal and returns `{ok, url}`.
  Code rejects anything that is not a clean https URL with a hostname.

Passwords are never typed. Rely on the browser's password manager or an SSO button
the OCR can read.

## Run folder

Every run writes `runs/<timestamp>/` so a stall can be replayed and fixed offline:

| file | contents |
|---|---|
| `run.log`, `run.json` | everything printed; goal, outcome, seconds, every action, config |
| `step-NN-raw.png` | the capture |
| `step-NN.png` | OCR blocks numbered in blue, the chosen one red, the focused field green |
| `step-NN-payload.txt` | the exact `state` and criteria sent to TypeSafe, then every block with box, click point, confidence |
| `step-NN-answers.json` | every probability the classifier returned |

Replay a saved capture as if it were live, without touching the screen:

```
uv run clicker "same goal" --image runs/<ts>/step-03-raw.png --app "Google Chrome" --url "https://example.com/"
```

```

A Linux port replaces `macos.py` with xdotool and AT-SPI, and swaps Vision OCR for
PaddleOCR or RapidOCR. Nothing else knows the platform.

The browser backend replaces `macos.py` with `browser/cdp.py` instead. Both are opt-in and
independent: a browser task never needs Screen Recording permission, and a canvas-only task
still wants the OCR path.

## Known limits

- OCR only sees text. Icon-only buttons and text over photos are invisible or garbled.
- Two identical labels get only a coarse region hint and split the vote.
- Only the main display is captured.
- Using the machine during an `--act` run fights it for focus and the cursor.
- The site catalog is small on purpose; the writer covers the rest.
